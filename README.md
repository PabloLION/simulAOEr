### Env Setup

1. Install or update poetry with `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -` (from [Poetry Official Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)). The update is needed especially if you are using an updated Python version.
2. Install dependencies with package manager "Poetry": `poetry install`. Try typing `poetry run saoe` or `poetry run pytest` to see if the dependencies are installed correctly. More shortcuts like "`{COMMAND}` for `poetry run {COMMAND}` after `poetry shell`" are available in [Poetry Official Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
