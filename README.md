## Goal

- Simulator of AOE2:DE build for multiple players.
- Implement some algorithm to see the best strategy for each civ / civ group strategy.
  - Like what's the best civ combination for 2/3/4 players.
  - What's the best strategy for civ-s vs civ-s.
  - What's the best play style for certain civ-s on a certain map.
  - Maybe use AI, but need metrics (hard to evaluate).
  - Maybe more simulation for battle field simulation.

### stack

- We are using Python / Flask now.

### CLI and API

- Current mature projects from [Siege Engineers](https://siegeengineers.org/projects)
- aoe2map.net for map scripts
- recs for training AI
- data mods [SiegeEngineers/auto-mods](https://github.com/SiegeEngineers/auto-mods)
- tech data [SiegeEngineers/halfon](https://github.com/SiegeEngineers/halfon/)
- more simulation with [OpenAge](https://blog.openage.dev/), [repo](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage) or [CaptureAge](https://captureage.com/) for metrics for AI.
