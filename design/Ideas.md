# Ideas to add to the project

1. A function to sim and calc a cost effectiveness of a fight.
2. A function by which we determine best civ comp and strat based of a selected map and number of players.
3. A function to sim vills needed based of cost, unit training time, vill gather rates and a civ of our choice.
4. A function to sim a BO and determines res collected based at a certain point of time of and can also tell us, how many res we need based of a strat of our choice (for example, if we say we want to FC 3 tc boom, it'll tell us we need 1300f 200g to get to castle age, 325w for bs mkt and ideally enough res for eco upgrades and 550w for extra TCs, mb also how many farms should be build before reaching castle age so we can sustain those TCs before we reach the threshold of 6 farm/tc w/o upgrades) 
5. A function to sim based of only collection rates and a number of vills, we can select a civ of our choice.
6. A function to sim a fight based of a tempo perspective, if its a good idea to fight a halb w/ pala if we get to raid their eco or gain a map control.
7. A function to sim a micro difference in a fight.
8. A function to sim a monk value how much of a diff a monk does in battle and enemy psychology.
